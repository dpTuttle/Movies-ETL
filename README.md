# Movies ETL

# Purpose

- The goal of this exercise was to take three data sources: Wikipedia Movie Data, Kaggle Ratings Data, and Kaggle Movies Metadata and use Extract, Transform and Load techniques to clean the data and load into a Postgres SQL Local Database. 

# Output

- Files were transformed, saved as .csv files, and then a function was created to load the data to the movie_data database.
